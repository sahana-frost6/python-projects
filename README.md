## 📁 Mini Projects & Practice

## BMR Calculator App – Python

A Python desktop application to calculate **Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)**, **Body Mass Index (BMI)**, and daily calorie requirements based on activity level. The app includes a graphical interface using **Tkinter** and visualizes calorie distribution with a **Matplotlib pie chart**. This project demonstrates GUI development, basic data processing, and visualization skills.

### Project Overview

The BMR Calculator App allows users to:

- Input personal details: gender, age, height, weight, and activity level  
- Calculate BMR using the Mifflin–St Jeor formula  
- Compute BMI and show the weight category (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese)  
- Suggest daily calories to maintain, lose, or gain weight  
- Display calorie distribution in a pie chart  

### Features

- Easy-to-use Tkinter GUI  
- Real-time calculation of BMR and BMI  
- Calorie suggestions for weight management  
- Matplotlib pie chart embedded inside the application  
- Input validation to prevent errors  

### Technologies Used

- Python 3  
- Tkinter for GUI  
- Matplotlib for chart visualization  

### Concepts Demonstrated

- GUI development with Tkinter  
- Data visualization with Matplotlib  
- Basic arithmetic and formulas in Python  
- Conditional logic (BMI categories)  
- Modular code design  

### How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sahana-frost6/python-projects.git
```
2. Navigate to the project folder

3. Run:

python bmr_calculator.py
